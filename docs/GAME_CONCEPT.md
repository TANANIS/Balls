# Game Concept

## 1. What Game Is This?

A 2D top-down, real-time survival action game.
The player keeps moving, attacking, and dodging. The only goal: survive longer.
No stages, no endings. Every run restarts.

---
## 2. What You Do During Play

Core flow:
1. Enemies keep spawning and closing in.
2. The screen gets denser, pressure rises.
3. You survive with movement, attacks, and dodges.
4. When you are about to break,
5. the game gives you one growth choice.
6. You pick, then continue with a faster tempo.
7. Too many hits -> death -> instant restart.

---
## 3. What The Player Is

The player is a circle.
No character backstory or narrative.
All states are expressed through color, brightness, and speed.

HP:
- Fixed at 3
- Each hit removes 1
- No auto-regen (only via in-run growth)

---
## 4. Controls (Dual Stick)

Movement:
- WASD / left stick
- 360-degree free movement
- You can always move

Attack direction:
- Mouse direction / right stick
- Only decides where to fire
- Wide hit judgment; no precision required

Action types (not bound yet):
1. A common attack (for rhythm)
2. A stronger action with longer cooldown
3. Mobility or dodge

Actual bindings (LMB/RMB/Space) will be decided later.

---
## 5. Feel Of Hitting Things

Only one goal: fast, satisfying, and clear.
Hit enemy -> see immediate result.
Kill feedback:
- Slight zoom in
- Brief pause
- Light burst

Mistakes hurt but never stall the flow.
No combo, no score pop-ups.

---
## 6. Enemies

All enemies are geometric shapes.
Behavior is simple and readable.
No teleport, no cheap tricks.

Pressure comes from:
- More enemies
- Closer distance
- Less free space

---
## 7. When You Level Up

There is a hidden pressure value.
Pressure rises when:
- Enemies are many
- HP is low
- No kills for a long time
- Space is tight

When pressure hits a threshold:
1. Game fully pauses
2. Screen clears
3. Two options appear
4. You pick one (or it randoms)
5. Game resumes at a faster tempo

This is not a reward. It is a breath before continuing.

---
## 8. What Growth Means

Growth only lasts for the current run; resets next run.
Growth can be:
- New attack patterns
- Changes to control feel
- Status effects (freeze, slow, etc.)
- Risk trades (stronger but more dangerous)

Rule:
> You should feel the change immediately after choosing.

No "strong later" upgrades.

---
## 9. Visual Style

- Geometric shapes
- High saturation
- Very bright, intense glare
- Heavy bloom

Like Geometry Dash's bright contamination, but not a rhythm game.
Rules:
- Dark background
- Bright enemies
- Brightest attacks
- No more than two primary colors at once
